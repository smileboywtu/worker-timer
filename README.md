worker timer
============

I have thought about designing a software to notify me about the time to rest. After a long time waiting, I just do it my own way.

there is free alternatives software of this kind but with many dependencies, which make them much more bigger and weight, I just need a simple and easy one.

just run the worker timer script. If you want to customer the notify ring, you can just downloads the media file and put it into the media directory. there is only one ring by default. you can look more information in the media directory. the default.wav file is downloads from the freesound.org.
